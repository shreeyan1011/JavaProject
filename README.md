# JavaProject

A small sample project made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Springboot, Microsoft SQL Server, and Maven. This project is about a recruitment website called "TalentHire" that lets users fill in their details in an HTML form, this data is then stored in a SQL database (JDBC connection) so that recruitment team can contact them when a suitable job opportunity arises for them. The functionality of sending an email to a user when they have forgotten their password and authenticating a user from the database during sign-in is also present in this project. Please read JavaProject decription.docx to know how this project works.
